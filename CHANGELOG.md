### Added
+ The system now has a native user interface for card hands. The 'ðŸ¦‹ Monarch' module remains usable as an alternative.
### Changed
+ As from this version of the system, Foundry V10 is the minimum required generation. Hosts who cannot migrate from V9 to V10 will need to keep using Castle Falkenstein v1.x

+ Chat messages the system generates will now, like OOC (Out Of Character) messages, have a border the same color as the user who triggered them.

### Changed

+ Decks will now be automatically reshuffled when a discard pile is reset or deleted.
+ Resetting or deleting a character's fortune or sorcery hand will now discard the cards it contained, rather than directly reinjecting them into the deck without reshuffle.
+ Deleting a character will now automatically delete (discard) any fortune or sorcery hand they had.
### Fixed
+ Duplicated characters will no longer reuse the fortune or sorcery hands of the copied character, and have their own.
