# Changelog

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/admiralnlson/castle-falkenstein-fvtt/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2022/03/16
### Added
+ With permission from RTG, added a deck preset based on [R. Talsorian Games Castle Falkenstein Fortune Deck visuals](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2020/07/24/falkenstein-friday-the-fortune-deck/).
+ Fortune/Sorcery decks (based on preset above) and discard piles are now created automatically the first time the game is started. They are recreated on F5 if one of them is missing. Users may still use their own custom decks if preferred via system settings.
+ Monarch (Card UI enhancement) module was made a dependency.
+ Card hand permissions are now updated accordingly each time character permissions are.
+ When a player draws a card from a deck and there are none left to draw, the corresponding discard pile is now shuffled back into the deck to satisfy the request.
+ Compendium pack for Abilities mentioned in the Corebook (English + French (requires Babele module))

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/admiralnlson/castle-falkenstein-fvtt/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2022/03/07
