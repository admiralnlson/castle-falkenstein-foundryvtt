# TODO

## Legend
+ MoSCoW: `[M]`ust, `[S]`hould, `[C]`ould, `[W]`on't
+ `[üî•]` Project maintainer (admiralnlson)'s own GM needs

### Bugs

### Derived stats & Racial abilities (a.k.a 'Other' tab)

+ `[S]` Extra 'Other' tab for listing secondary attributes such as Speed (Run+Flight) or Languages known (see below)
+ Free text (w/ compendium?), specific labels with rw input, specific labels with auto-computed values?
  + Languages
  + Corebook p140 / Libre de base p194
    + Running speed (Athletics) / Vitesse de course (Athl√©tisme)
    + Flying Speeds (Faerie Etherealness or Dragon/Animal Physique) / Vitesses de vol (√âth√©ralit√© et Physique)
+ `[S]` Add a species drop-down list (Human/Fae/Dragon/Dwarf) and add species-specific behaviour:
  + give Fae talents to Fae characters only
  + compute health automatically incl. Dragons' +2
  + limit Dragon sorcery to 5 cards drawn
  + list species features such as Dwarf's immunity to Fire, Fae sensibility to Iron in the sheet, ..
    + Faerie Powers
      + potentially split "Fae" into "Fae (generic) / Fae (Brownie) / Fae (Pixie) / Fae (Lord/Lady)" for extra setup of non-generic Fae characters.
    + Dwarf Powers
    + Dragon
      + Flying
      + Shapeshift
      + Armor
      + 5 max Power drawn

### Cards

+ `[C]` Macro to delete all Host character Sorcery hands
+ `[C]` Card hand button to show a Fortune or Sorcery hand in chat (or simply on screen)
+ `[S]` deplete Host or character hands before changing Decks (maybe ask for confirmation first)
+ `[C]` allow actors to use another actor's (/ player's) Fortune hand ("Host Notes" tab becomes "Host tab")
  + consider attaching Fortune hands to players as opposed to actors? (although this may reduce options)

### Sorcery

+ `[S]` Release Power - Prevent releasing of aligned Power (or at least add confirmation dialog)
+ `[S]` Sorcery hand - Show the harmonic type on unaligned power cards (on the cards themselves)
+ `[S]` Allow to combine multiple spells together (CiL-en p85)
+ `[C]` Cooperation on spellcasting - implement sopmething specific for this (ROI not great) or just document in the userguide how to do it with the current version of the system
+ `[S]` Explicit mechanic for Artefacts
+ `[S]` Explicit mechanic for Unraveling
+ `[C]` Confirmation dialog for Hosts when they 'Gather Power' for a Host character and 'Self Roll' isn't active
