# TODO

## Legend
+ MoSCoW: `[M]`ust, `[S]`hould, `[C]`ould, `[W]`on't
+ `[üî•]` Project maintainer (admiralnlson)'s own GM needs

## Evolutions

### Explicit user requests

| User | Request |
|------|:--------|
| Dame du Lac | `[S]` Extra 'Other' tab for listing secondary attributes such as Speed (Run+Flight) or Languages known |
| Dame du Lac | `[C]` Have abilities display as 2+ columns if there is enough horizontal space (and ensure 2 in the default width) |
| mite.railleuse | Duel system |

### Cards

+ `[M]` Remove the dependency to Monarch by proposing a default Hand sheet implem (enabled by default).

+ `[Müî•]` Make sure drawn cards always appear to the right (might be the case with Monarch already but don't think it will be the case for the CF-default hand)

+ `[S]` Reset the character's Fortune/Sorcery hands and delete them when a character is deleted

+ `[C]` Button in World settings (Host only) to delete all NPC hands

+ `[C]` Card hand button to show a Fortune or Sorcery hand in chat

### Sorcery

+ `[Müî•]` Define Spell - Allow user to specify a custom bonus/malus (with label?) at spell definition time
+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Sorcery specialization** (as opposed to the raw Sorcery level)
+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Artefacts**
+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Unraveling**

+ `[S]` Cast Spell - chat message - add a box showing power gathered vs initial requirement.
+ `[S]` Cast Spell - chat message - if unaligned power was used, show harmonic type(s) (up to 3 for the GM to choose from in case of ex-aequo).
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - Open a dialog on GM side to ask which harmonic they prefer, then display the choice in chat.
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - When enough aligned Power has been drawn, the spell is immediately cast also (no harmonics generated) or a chat message is generated at least.
+ `[S]` Cast Spell - When a Joker is drawn, the spell is immediately cast a.k.a. **Wild Spell** (fr: Surcharge thaumique)

+ `[C]` Release Power - Prevent releasing of aligned Power (or at least add confirmation dialog)
+ `[S]` Release Power - Show the harmonic type on unaligned power cards
  + Spades / Spiritual (fr: spirituelle)
  + Hearts / Emotional (fr: √©motionnelle)
  + Diamonds / Material (fr: mat√©rielle)
  + Clubs / Elemental (fr: √©l√©mentaire)

+ `[C]` Cooperation on spellcasting - implement sopmething specific for this (ROI not great) or just document in the userguide how to do it with the current version of the system

+ `[C]` Confirmation dialog for Hosts when they 'Gather Power' for a Host character and 'Self Roll' isn't active
