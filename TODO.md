## Legend
+ MoSCoW: `[M]`ust, `[S]`hould, `[C]`ould, `[W]`on't
+ `[üî•]` Project maintainer (admiralnlson)'s own GM needs

### Bugs
+ `[Müî•]` Jokers are supposed to be Red and Black
+ `[Müî•]` Cards which are played are not supposed to go in a discard pile in CF. They are to go back to the deck directly.
+ `[Müî•]` Cards cannot be dropped onto an empty hand because the contain (ol.cards) has a width and heigh of 0.

### Derived stats & Racial abilities (a.k.a 'Other' tab)

+ `[S]` Extra 'Other' tab for listing secondary attributes such as Speed (Run+Flight) or Languages known (see below)

  + limit Dragon sorcery to 5 cards drawn
  + list species features such as Dwarf's immunity to Fire, Fae sensibility to Iron in the sheet, ..
    + Faerie Powers
      + potentially split "Fae" into "Fae (generic) / Fae (Brownie) / Fae (Pixie) / Fae (Lord/Lady)" for extra setup of non-generic Fae characters.
    + Dwarf Powers
    + Dragon
      + Flying
      + Shapeshift
      + Armor
      + 5 max Power drawn

### Cards

+ `[C]` Macro to delete all Host character hands

+ `[M]` deplete Host or character hands before changing the Fortune discard pile (maybe ask for confirmation first)
