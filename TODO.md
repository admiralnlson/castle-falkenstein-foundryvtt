# TODO list
+ Fix Description/Diary editor being too high / scrollbar not being used (scrollbar of the sheet itself is used)
+ Put "Limited" and "Observer" permissions at the same level (no access to Journal, etc..)
+ Weapons list and sheet (under 'Possessions' or dedicated tab)
+ Add 'Fortune Deck' as a preset  
    + Ask Talsorian if OK to add the card images directly within the game system
        + if yes, then (ask if OK to) convert them to .webp to limit bandwidth/storage usage
        + if not, then assume GM will download the deck on their own and has put it in a specific Data/ folder
+ Compendium with the standard abilities, or add all core ones to the Abilities tab
+ Sections for Cash/Money under 'Possessions'
+ List lorebooks under Spells (-> rename to High Sorcery?) tab
+ Red color for hearts and diamonds in 'select' controls
+ [TBC] Possessions 'location' (incl. 'on me') property
