# TODO

## Legend
+ MoSCoW: `[M]`ust, `[S]`hould, `[C]`ould, `[W]`on't
+ `[ðŸ”¥]` Project maintainer (admiralnlson)'s own GM needs
+ RTG = R. Talsorian Games

## Evolutions

### Cards

+ Auto-deck/piles
  + `[M]` (if user.isGM) Auto-create the Fortune & Sorcery Decks & piles 'onInit' if none is defined or the Id points to a missing deck
    + make sure to update setting values when doing so
    + shuffle any newly created decks
    + add ui.notifications when creating(/shuffling) decks or piles
  + `[M]` (as GM, via socket) Auto-reset piles when a 'draw' action cannot be fulfilled due to lack of cards in the deck
  + `[M]` Draw Fortunecards 1 by 1 rather than in bulk to avoid pile reset from happening too early
    + draw cards 1 by 1 for Fortune cards to ensure reset does not happen to soon

+ `[M]` reset the character's Fortune/Sorcery hands and delete them when a character is deleted

+ `[M]` Refine onReady warning display about fortune/sorcery decks/piles. Perform more elaborate checks:
  + onReady, error if deck/pile setting left blank
  + warn if deck/pile mentioned in settings was deleted
  + on settings submit, error if  Fortune and Sorcery Decks/Piles are the same (or prevent it by removing them for the selection list)
  + error is not all defined at settings submit
  + warn at onReady if there are unmapped decks in the world
  + warn at onReady if a player connects and does not have access to the fortune deck --> add this to README explaining that it is for people who manage multiple tables, etc.
  + add i18n

+ `[M]` CF deck preset - i18n
+ `[M]` CF deck preset - English l10n
+ `[M]` CF deck preset - French l10n

+ `[CðŸ”¥]` Simplify shuffling of discarded cards back into Decks. Either:
  + remove discard piles altogether, and send cards played directly back to the deck they belong to, or
  + have discard piles auto-reset on draw, with a notification message in chat
    + `[C]` Consider replacing Fortune/Sorcery discard pile selection system setting with **Automatic creation of discard piles** (in the same folder as their respective Decks)

+ `[C]` Button to 'show players' a hand

+ `[S]` 'Draw Fortune Card' button, useful in some scenarios (such as when a character loses all health: in an optional rule, drawing a spades card = character dies) or to help with determining purely random outcomes

+ `[M]` Add an error toast and ensure proper error mgt when Fortune/Discard Deck/Pile have not be defined in system settings or have been deleted since.
  + Consider upgrading the permissions on Fortune/Sorcery decks and discard piles automatically (or at least ask the GM if they want to)

+ `[M]` Prevent error "User <playername> lacks permission to create new Cards", by either
  + creating hands for player-owned characters after certain (Assitant-)GM actions (e.g. listening to events where a player made the owner of a character)
  + delegating the action to the GM programmatically via socket (but then the GM has to be present..)

+ `[S]` When accepting a user deck in the Settings, ensure its compatibility with Castle Falkenstein rules
  + checks suits have values spades/hearts/diamonds/clubs/joker and if not, error / reject the deck
  + check aces have value 14 and if not, open a dialog to ask if OK to give them value 14
  + check jokers have value 15 and if not, open a dialog to ask if OK to give them value 15
  + `[C]` check number of cards per suit is 13 and that there are 2 jokers, and show warning if not

+ `[M]` Document that Monarch (or other) Hand UI should be activated manually by the GM (or enable them programmatically in the system).

+ `[C]` Shortcut in Settings to delete all empty Castle Falkenstein hands (useful when many hands created for NPCs).

### Sorcery

+ `[SðŸ”¥]` Add a **Show Players** button on Actor sheets to avoid FoundryVTT Core Actor/Journal duplication of NPCs

+ `[MðŸ”¥]` Define Spell - Allow user to specify a custom bonus/malus (with label) at spell definition time:
+ `[C]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Sorcery specialization** (as opposed to the raw Sorcery level)
+ `[C]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Artefacts**
+ `[C]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Unraveling**

+ `[MðŸ”¥]` Cast Spell - chat message - add a box showing power gathered vs initial requirement.
+ `[S]` Cast Spell - chat message - if unaligned power was used, show harmonic type(s) (up to 3 for the GM to choose from in case of ex-aequo).
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - Open a dialog on GM side to ask which harmonic they prefer, then display the choice in chat.
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - When enough aligned Power has been drawn, the spell is immediately cast also (no harmonics generated) or a chat message is generated at least.
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - When a Joker is drawn, the spell is immediately cast a.k.a. **Wild Spell** (fr: Surcharge thaumique)

+ `[M]` Release Power - Prevent releasing of aligned Power (or at least add confirmation dialog)
+ `[C]` Release Power - Show the harmonic type on unaligned power cards
  + Spades / Spiritual (fr: spirituelle)
  + Hearts / Emotional (fr: Ã©motionnelle)
  + Diamonds / Material (fr: matÃ©rielle)
  + Clubs / Elemental (fr: Ã©lÃ©mentaire)

+ `[C]` Cooperation on spellcasting - implement sopmething specific for this (ROI not great) or just document how to do it with the current version of the system in the Doc

+ `[C]` Button for GM to collect Power to simulate actvity from other Wizards within 15km (work-around: do it with a generic character although it will still be visible to players)

### Other

+ `[S]` Weapons list (under 'Possessions' or dedicated tab), dedicated sheet and chat message

+ `[S]` add Castle Falkenstein logo somewhere in the character sheet

+ `[M]` i18n for ui.notification.'s

+ `[S]` match ability/spell macro icon with the card hand one used in the ability/spell list)

+ `[C]` add some https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/repository-bling

+ Find better icons for Abilities and Spells (or remove the need for them?)

+ Ability data packs (keeping their description to a minimum as per RTG Homebrew Content policy)
  + `[âœ“]` English - from Corebook
  + `[âœ“]` French - from Corebook
  + `[S]` English - from sourcebooks
  + `[S]` French - from sourcebooks
  + `[M]` Shortcut to import all Abilities from a data pack (must not introduce duplicates, but may fix incorrect suit assignments)

+ Lorebook data packs (keeping their description to a minimum as per RTG Homebrew Content policy)
  + `[M]` English - from Corebook
  + `[M]` French - from Corebook
  + `[S]` English - from sourcebooks
  + `[S]` French - from sourcebooks

+ `[S]` Fortune hand for the Host, which NPCs (PCs not owned by a player) use

+ Possessions:
  + `[C]` 'on me' / 'location' property
  + `[C]` Dedicated Cash/Money entry

+ `[C]` Add a species drop-down list (Human/Fae/Dragon/Dwarf) and add species-specific behaviour:
  + give Fae talents to Fae characters only
  + compute health automatically incl. Dragons' +2
  + limit Dragon sorcery hands to 5 cards max
  + list species features such as Dwarf's immunity to Fire, Fae sensibility to Iron in the sheet, ..)
  + potentially split "Fae" into "Fae (generic) / Fae (Brownie) / Fae (Pixie) / Fae (Lord/Lady)" for extra setup of non-generic Fae characters.

+ `[C]` Consider an i18n of packs which does not require Babele e.g. via something like:
```
Hooks.on("renderCompendiumDirectory", (app, html) => {
    game.packs.forEach(p => {
        if (!p.metadata.name.includes(game.i18n.lang)) {
            html[0].querySelector(`[data-pack='${p.metadata.package}.${p.metadata.name}']`).remove();
        }
    });
});
```
