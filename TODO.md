# TODO

## Legend

+ MoSCoW: `[M]`ust, `[S]`hould, `[C]`ould, `[W]`on't
+ `[ðŸ”¥]` Personal project maintainer GM needs
+ RTG = R. Talsorian Games

## Evolutions

+ `[S]` Enhance the visual appeal, possibly adding the Castle Falkenstein logo somewhere in the character sheet (with RTG's permission)

+ `[M]` Consider skipping the need for discard piles altogether, and instead sending cards played back to their origin decks (= card reset)
  + In the book, it says Sorcery cards which are of the wrong Aspect may be put at the bottom of the Sorcery deck.

+ `[MðŸ”¥]` Spellcasting
  + Character owner may **Define a Spell** (trigger from "Cast Spell" button next to each spell in char sheet > spells tab)
    + if the Character is already casting a spell, a notification is generated telling the user to cancel the ongoing spell first
  + From a Sorcery hand, the user (if owner) may **Gather Power** (fr: Canaliser du pouvoir) -> chat message indicates advancement when the power gathered is aligned or not
    + button is disabled if no Spell is being cast
    + the chat message indicates advancement advancement towards the goal and whether the power gathered is aligned or not
    + Ideally the 'Release' button label is updated to show if Harmonics will be generated (in extremely rare cases, there can be up to 3 ex-aequo harmonics for the GM to choose from)
  + From a Sorcery hand, the user (if owner) may **Release unaligned power** (fr: Disperser le pouvoir non-alignÃ©) at any time -> custom chat message generated?
    + button is hidden on cards with an aligned suit
  + Character owner may **Unravel** (fr: DÃ©tramer) to collect aligned power (1 point of Health per 2 points of Thaumic Power) --> chat message generated
    + button is disabled if no Spell is being cast
  + From a Sorcery hand, the user (if owner) may **Cancel the spell**, which discards their Sorcery hand and stops the ongoing spell -> chat message generated
    + button is disabled if no Spell is being cast
  + Character owner may **Cast (the spell)** (fr: Lancer le sort) when they have gathered enough Power --> chat message generated
    + button is disabled if not enough Power has been gathered
  + When a Joker is drawn, the spell is immediately cast a.k.a. **Wild Spell** (fr: Surcharge thaumique)
  + When enough aligned Power has been drawn, the spell is immediately cast also (no harmonics generated) or a chat message is generated at least.
  + The nature of Harmonics is shown at least on the 'spell cast' message, but possibly on cards as well:
    + Spades / Spiritual (fr: spirituelle)
    + Hearts / Emotional (fr: Ã©motionnelle)
    + Diamonds / Material (fr: matÃ©rielle)
    + Clubs / Elemental (fr: Ã©lÃ©mentaire)
