# TODO

+ `[üî•]` Project maintainer (admiralnlson)'s own GM needs

## `[M]` Core version compatibility

  + Core v9 => CFv1.x
  + Core v10 => CFv2.x
    + declare CF settings as not requiring a reload

## Feature evolutions

### Explicit user requests

| User           | Request |
|----------------|:--------|
| Dame du Lac    | `[S]` Extra 'Other' tab for listing secondary attributes such as Speed (Run+Flight) or Languages known (see below) |
| Dame du Lac    | `[C]` Have abilities display as 2+ columns if there is enough horizontal space (and ensure 2 in the default width) |
| mite.railleuse | `[S]` Duel system |

### `[üî•]` Derived stats & Racial abilities (a.k.a 'Other' tab)

+ Free text (w/ compendium?), specific labels with rw input, specific labels with auto-computed values?
  + Languages
  + Faerie Power
  + Corebook p140 / Libre de base p194
    + Running speed (Athletics) / Vitesse de course (Athl√©tisme)
    + Flying Speeds (Faerie Etherealness or Dragon/Animal Physique) / Vitesses de vol (√âth√©ralit√© et Physique)
  + Dragon
    + Flying
    + Shapeshift
    + Armor
    + help users with Dragon attack levels (because the Corebook and Curious Creatures do not match)

+ `[S]` Add a species drop-down list (Human/Fae/Dragon/Dwarf) and add species-specific behaviour:
  + give Fae talents to Fae characters only
  + compute health automatically incl. Dragons' +2
  + limit Dragon sorcery hands to 5 cards max
  + list species features such as Dwarf's immunity to Fire, Fae sensibility to Iron in the sheet, ..)
  + potentially split "Fae" into "Fae (generic) / Fae (Brownie) / Fae (Pixie) / Fae (Lord/Lady)" for extra setup of non-generic Fae characters.

### Cards

+ `[S]` Shortcut to 'refill' the fortune hand in the Perform Feat form, or at least refresh the form when fortune cards are drawn from the hand itself

+ `[S]` Remove the dependency to Monarch by proposing a default Hand sheet implem (enabled by default).
  + `[Süî•]` Make sure drawn cards always appear to the right (might be the case with Monarch already but don't think it will be the case for the CF-default hand)

+ `[C]` Macro to delete all Host character hands

+ `[C]` Card hand button to show a Fortune or Sorcery hand in chat

### Sorcery

+ `[Müî•]` Define Spell - Allow user to specify a custom bonus/malus (with label?) at spell definition time

+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Artefacts**
+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Unraveling**

+ `[S]` Display the name of the spell being cast in the hand itself or in the cast/cancel tooltip only and/or in the char sheet
+ `[S]` Cast Spell - chat message - add a box showing power gathered vs initial requirement.
+ `[S]` Cast Spell - chat message - if unaligned power was used, show harmonic type(s) (up to 3 for the GM to choose from in case of ex-aequo).
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - Open a dialog on GM side to ask which harmonic they prefer, then display the choice in chat.
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - When enough aligned Power has been drawn, the spell is immediately cast also (no harmonics generated) or a chat message is generated at least.
+ `[S]` Cast Spell - When a Joker is drawn, the spell is immediately cast a.k.a. **Wild Spell** (fr: Surcharge thaumique)

+ `[C]` Release Power - Prevent releasing of aligned Power (or at least add confirmation dialog)
+ `[S]` Release Power - Show the harmonic type on unaligned power cards
  + Spades / Spiritual (fr: spirituelle)
  + Hearts / Emotional (fr: √©motionnelle)
  + Diamonds / Material (fr: mat√©rielle)
  + Clubs / Elemental (fr: √©l√©mentaire)

+ `[C]` Cooperation on spellcasting - implement sopmething specific for this (ROI not great) or just document in the userguide how to do it with the current version of the system

+ `[C]` Confirmation dialog for Hosts when they 'Gather Power' for a Host character and 'Self Roll' isn't active
