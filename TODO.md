## `[M]` Bugs

+ Fortune/Sorcery hand linking issue for unlinked tokens and duplicated actors
  + (re)create the Host fortune hand like Fortune/Sorcery deck & discard piles & add corresponding setting
  + in fortune/sorcery hand getter,
    + search for the hand in game.cards using flags (actor id)
      + Add "\[Token\]" prefix to token hands
      + Check that unlinked tokens hands are recognized properly (= do not interfere with the hand of their actor)
    + stop caching the id of hands in the actor data (or using these ids anywhere)
    + if no such hand exists
      + if (fortune && (the actor is not owned by any player)) then
        + return the GM fortune hand
      + else, create the missing hand and return it
  + On duplication of Actor, set 'spellBeingCast.spell' to ''
  + on actor permission change, if no player owns the actor anymore, delete the dedicated fortuneHand (maybe with a confirmation popup?)
  + on deleteActor, delete the actor's fortune & sorcery hand if they exist (make sure an unlinked token does not delete the hand of the original actor)
  + On updateToken w/ change.actorLink==true, delete the token's fortune hand (attached to the unlinked token) if it exists
  + Prevent the use of Sorcery on unlinked tokens (have the tab empty except for a message mentioning Sorcery only allowed for tokens linked to an actor)
  + Support for Sorcery in unlinked tokens
    + Prevent it (have the tab empty except for a message mentioning Sorcery only allowed for tokens linked to an actor) OR
    + Allow it
      + On createToken, if (token).data.token.isLinked==false, set 'spellBeingCast.spell' to ''
      + On updateToken w/ change.actorLink==true, delete the token's fortune hand (attached to the unlinked token) if it exists
      + on deleteToken, if delete the token's sorcery hand if it exists
