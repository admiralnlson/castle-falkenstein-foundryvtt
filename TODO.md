# TODO

## Legend
+ MoSCoW: `[M]`ust, `[S]`hould, `[C]`ould, `[W]`on't
+ `[üî•]` Project maintainer (admiralnlson)'s own GM needs
+ `[‚úì]` Done but kept in the list for info
+ RTG = R. Talsorian Games

## Evolutions

### Cards

+ `[M]` 'Draw a single Fortune Card' button (outside of Feats), useful in some scenarios such as when a character loses all health: in an optional rule, drawing a spades card = character dies) or to help with determining purely random outcomes

+ `[S]` reset the character's Fortune/Sorcery hands and delete them when a character is deleted

+ `[C]` on Ready, display warnings about fortune/sorcery decks/piles. Perform more elaborate checks:
+ `[C]` on settings submit, error if Fortune and Sorcery Decks/Piles are the same (or prevent it by removing them for the selection list)
+ `[C]` error is not all defined at settings submit

+ `[C]` button in World settings (Host only) to delete all NPC hands

+ `[C]` Button to 'show players' a hand

### Sorcery

+ `[Müî•]` Define Spell - Allow user to specify a custom bonus/malus (with label) at spell definition time:
+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Artefacts**
+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Unraveling**
+ `[S]` Define Spell - explicit mechanic for using **Sorcery specialization** (as opposed to the raw Sorcery level)

+ `[S]` Cast Spell - chat message - add a box showing power gathered vs initial requirement.
+ `[S]` Cast Spell - chat message - if unaligned power was used, show harmonic type(s) (up to 3 for the GM to choose from in case of ex-aequo).
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - Open a dialog on GM side to ask which harmonic they prefer, then display the choice in chat.
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - When enough aligned Power has been drawn, the spell is immediately cast also (no harmonics generated) or a chat message is generated at least.
+ `[C]` Cast Spell - When a Joker is drawn, the spell is immediately cast a.k.a. **Wild Spell** (fr: Surcharge thaumique)

+ `[M]` Release Power - Prevent releasing of aligned Power (or at least add confirmation dialog)
+ `[C]` Release Power - Show the harmonic type on unaligned power cards
  + Spades / Spiritual (fr: spirituelle)
  + Hearts / Emotional (fr: √©motionnelle)
  + Diamonds / Material (fr: mat√©rielle)
  + Clubs / Elemental (fr: √©l√©mentaire)

+ `[C]` Cooperation on spellcasting - implement sopmething specific for this (ROI not great) or just document how to do it with the current version of the system in the Doc

+ `[C]` Button for GM to (silently) collect Power to simulate actvity from other Wizards within 15km (work-around: do it with a generic character although it will still be visible to players)
