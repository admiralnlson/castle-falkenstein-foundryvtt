# Castle Falkenstein FoundryVTT system - User Guide

# Pre-requisites
The first step to using this system is to make you create create some card decks (see "New Europa-stylized deck" below) and discard piles within FoundryVTT:

|To create             |Type |Player permissions to define                          |
|:---------------------|:----|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| Fortune Deck         |Deck | Limited                                              |
| Fortune discard pile |Pile | Observer                                             |
| Fortune Deck         |Deck | Limited (relevant for Sorcerer/Dragon players only)  |
| Sorcery discard pile |Pile | Observer (relevant for Sorcerer/Dragon players only) |

Once done, go to `Configure Settings > System Settings > Castle Falkenstein` to associate these 4 deck/piles to the Castle Falkenstein system.

Make sure you shuffle the decks before your players get a chance to draw cards from them also.

(N.B. this pre-requisite may very well be automated in a future version).

## New Europa-stylized deck
This system is pre-configured to support the New Europa-stylized deck avaible free-of-charge on [R. Talsorian Games's website](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2020/07/24/falkenstein-friday-the-fortune-deck/).

In order to use it, make sure you download the ZIP file and extract the .jpg images into this folder: `{your FoundryVTT Data/ directory}/cards/RTG-CF-FortuneDeck/`.
Once done, you may then use the dedicated preset within FoundryVTT:

# Character Sheet
The same character sheet is used for PCs and NPCs.

As per FoundryVTT default behaviour, if the permission level granted to a non-GM player on a character is 'None' (default), then the character does not appear to the player in the Actors tab.

And here is what happens with higher permission levels:

| Character sheet part | Limited | Observer | Owner  | Host (GM) |
|----------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Avatar               | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Name                 | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Health & Wounds      | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Description          | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Diary                | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Abilities            | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Possessions          | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Spells               | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Host Notes           | -       | -        | -      | Update    |

General recommendation for the Host:
- give each player an 'Owner' permission on their PC
- give all players a 'Limited' permission on PCs which are not their own
- during sessions, give players a 'Limited' permission on NPCs they meet, and do not put secret information in the 'Description' tab of these NPC sheets (unless you explicitly use the 'Secret' formatting option for it)

## Alternative: Diaries as ðŸ“– Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character diaries being a part of the world, the Host may elect to use dedicated ðŸ“– Journal Entries for each Player Character's (or NPC's) Diary.
In this case, the ðŸ“– Journal Entry should probably be drag-and-dropped into the Journal tab of the Character Sheet afterwards, for easier access by the player and Host.
