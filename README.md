## User guide
See [USERGUIDE](./doc/USERGUIDE.md)

## Release notes
See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Supported languages
The system supports localization. But, at this stage, only the following languages are supported:
+ English
+ French<sup>(1)</sup>

<sup>(1)</sup> Translations of compendium packs (list of abilities & spells) require the 'Babele' module to be installed and activated.

To submit translations for other languages, see [Contributions](#contributions) below.

## Dependencies
In order to benefit from all features provided by this system, you need a Cards UI cutomization module with which the Castle Falkenstein system is pre-integrated.

By default, the system uses enhanced sheets for **Hands** and **Cards** (since they're customized) and leaves core ones for **Decks** and **Piles** (since they are not customized). But you may use the enhanced sheets for **Decks** and **Piles** also if you wish.
