## User guide

### System Configuration
Before you may use this system, you need to create some decks and card piles within FoundryVTT:

| Create               | Required player permissions                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Fortune Deck         | Limited                                              |
| Fortune discard pile | Observer (relevant for Sorcerer/Dragon players only) |
| Fortune Deck         | Limited                                              |
| Sorcery discard pile | Observer (relevant for Sorcerer/Dragon players only) |

(N.B. this manual process may very well be automated in a future version of this System)

Once done, go to `Configure Settings > System Settings > Castle Falkenstein` to associate these 4 deck/piles to the Castle Falkenstein system.

#### Castle Falkenstein-styled deck
Once this system has been installed, an 'Castle Falkstein' deck preset becomes available within the FoundryVTT deck creation menu.
In order to actually use it however, you have to manually download the deck from [R. Talsorian Games's website](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2020/07/24/falkenstein-friday-the-fortune-deck/), unzip it and place the .jpg card images within directory `{your FoundryVTT's Data/ directory}/cards/RTG-CF-FortuneDeck/`.

### Character Sheet
A unique character sheet is used for PCs and NPCs.

As per FoundryVTT default behaviour, if the permission level granted to a non-GM Player on a character is 'None' (default), then the character does not appear to the player in the Actors tab.
Now here is what happens with higher Player permission levels:

| Character sheet part | Limited | Observer | Owner  | Host (GM) |
|----------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Avatar               | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Name                 | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Health & Wounds      | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Description          | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Diary                | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Abilities            | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Possessions          | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Spells               | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Host Notes           | -       | -        | -      | Update    |

General recommendation:
- give each player an 'Owner' permission on their PC
- give all players a 'Limited' permission on PCs which are not their own
- give all players a 'Limited' permission on NPCs they know exist, and do not put any sensible information in the 'Description' tab of these NPC sheets.

### Alternative: Diaries as ðŸ“– Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character diaries being a part of the world of Castle Falkenstein, the Host may elect to use dedicated ðŸ“– Journal Entries for each Player Character's (or NPC's) Diary.
In this case, the ðŸ“– Journal Entry should probably be drag-and-dropped into the Journal tab of the Character Sheet afterwards, for easier access by the player or Host.

### Card hands
It is highly recommended that you use this system with a Cards UI enhancement module.

| Module                                                                   | Compatibility with the Castle Falkenstein system |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [ðŸ¦‹ Monarch](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monarch)                    | âœ… Full compatibility                           |
| [Ready To Use Cards](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ready-to-use-cards) | âŒ› Not compatible yet, but planned               |
