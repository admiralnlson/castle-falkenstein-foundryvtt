## How to use the Character Sheet
The same character sheet is used for both PCs and NPCs.

The following permissions are defined on it:
| Sheet element    | Limited | Observer | Owner  | Host (GM) |
|------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Name             | Read    | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Health & Wound   | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Description      | Read    | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Diary            | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Abilities        | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Possessions      | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Spells           | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Host Notes       | -       | -        | -      | Update    |

### Diaries as actual Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character journals being a part of the world, the Host may elect to have dedicated Journal Entries for the Player Character's Diaries.
In this case, theJournal entry should be drag-and-dropped into the Character Sheet Journal tab for quick access.
