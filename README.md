## User guide

### System Configuration
Before you may use this system, you need to create the following card elements:
- Fortune Deck* (with Limited permissions for your players)
- Fortune discard pile (with Observer permissions for your players)
- Sorcery Deck* (with Limited permissions for your players, or at least the ones playing a Sorcerer or Dragon)
- Sorcery discard pile (with Observer permissions for your players, or at least the ones playing a Sorcerer or Dragon)

Once done, go to `Configure Settings > System Settings` and pick these 4 deck/piles.

#### Castle Falkenstein-styled deck
When using this system, an official 'Castle Falkstein' deck preset is available in the deck creation menu.
In order to actually use it however, you have to manually download the deck yourself from [R. Talsorian Games's website](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2020/07/24/falkenstein-friday-the-fortune-deck/), unzip the contents and place the card .jpg files in directory `{your FoundryVTT's Data/ directory}/cards/RTG-CF-FortuneDeck/`.

### Character Sheet
A unique character sheet is used for PCs and NPCs.

As per FoundryVTT default behaviour, if the permission level granted to a non-GM Player on a character is 'None' (default), then the character does not appear to the player in the Actors tab.
Now here is what happens with higher Player permission levels:

| Character sheet part | Limited | Observer | Owner  | Host (GM) |
|----------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Avatar               | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Name                 | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Health & Wounds      | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Description          | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Diary                | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Abilities            | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Possessions          | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Spells               | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Host Notes           | -       | -        | -      | Update    |

General recommendation:
- give each player an 'Owner' permission on their PC
- give all players a 'Limited' permission on PCs which are not their own
- give all players a 'Limited' permission on NPCs they know exist, and do not put any sensible information in the 'Description' tab of these NPC sheets.

### Alternative: Diaries as ðŸ“– Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character diaries being a part of the world of Castle Falkenstein, the Host may elect to use dedicated ðŸ“– Journal Entries for each Player Character's (or NPC's) Diary.
In this case, the ðŸ“– Journal Entry should probably be drag-and-dropped into the Journal tab of the Character Sheet afterwards, for easier access by the player or Host.

### Card hands
It is highly recommended that you use this system with a Cards UI enhancement module.

| Module                                                                   | Compatibility with the Castle Falkenstein system |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [ðŸ¦‹ Monarch](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monarch)                    | âœ… Full compatibility                           |
