## How to use the Character Sheet
The same character sheet is used for both PCs and NPCs.

The following permissions are defined on it:
| Sheet element    | Limited | Observer | Owner  | Host (GM) |
|------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Name             | Read    | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Health & Wound   | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Description      | Read    | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Diary            | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Abilities        | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Possessions      | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Spells           | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Host Notes       | -       | -        | -      | Update    |

### Alternative: Diaries as ðŸ“– Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character diaries being a part of the world of Castle Falkenstein, the Host may elect to use dedicated ðŸ“– Journal Entries for each Player Character's (or NPC's) Diary.
In this case, the journal entry should probably be drag-and-dropped into the Journal tab of the Character Sheet for quick access by the player or Host.
