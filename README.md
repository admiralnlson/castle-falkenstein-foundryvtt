### Diaries as actual Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character journals being a part of the world, the Host may elect to have dedicated Journal Entries for the Player Character's Diaries.
In this case, theJournal entry should be drag-and-dropped into the Character Sheet Journal tab for quick access.
