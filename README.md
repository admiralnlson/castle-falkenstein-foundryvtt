## How to use the Character Sheet

The character sheet is the same for PCs and NPCs.

The following permissions are defined:

| Tab             | Limited | Observer | Owner  | Host (GM) |
|-----------------|---------|:--------:|:------:|-----------|
| Description     | Read    | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Health & Wounds | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Diary           | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Description     | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Possessions     | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Spells          | -       | Read     | Update | Update    |
| Host Notes      | -       | -        | -      | Update    |

### Diaries as actual Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character journals being a part of the world, the Host may elect to have dedicated Journal Entries for the Player Character's Diaries.
In this case, theJournal entry should be drag-and-dropped into the Character Sheet Journal tab for quick access.
