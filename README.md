## System Configuration
Before you can use this system, you need to create some decks and card piles within FoundryVTT:

| Create               | Required player permissions                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Fortune Deck         | Limited                                              |
| Fortune discard pile | Observer (relevant for Sorcerer/Dragon players only) |
| Fortune Deck         | Limited                                              |
| Sorcery discard pile | Observer (relevant for Sorcerer/Dragon players only) |

Once done, go to `Configure Settings > System Settings > Castle Falkenstein` to associate these 4 deck/piles to the Castle Falkenstein system.

(N.B. this manual process may very well be automated in a future version.)

### New Europa-styled cards
This system is pre-configured to use the 'Castle Falkstein' deck avaible free-of-charge on [R. Talsorian Games's website](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2020/07/24/falkenstein-friday-the-fortune-deck/).
In order to use it, make sure you download the ZIP file and extract into this folder: `{your FoundryVTT's Data/ directory}/cards/RTG-CF-FortuneDeck/`.
Then use the preset within FoundryVTT:

## Character Sheet
The same character sheet is used for PCs and NPCs.

As per FoundryVTT default behaviour, if the permission level granted to a non-GM Player on a character is 'None' (default), then the character does not appear to the player in the Actors tab.

And here is what happens with higher Player permission levels:

| Character sheet part | Limited | Observer | Owner  | Host (GM) |
|----------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|
| Avatar               | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Name                 | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Health & Wounds      | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Description          | View    | View     | Update | Update    |
| Diary                | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Abilities            | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Possessions          | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Spells               | -       | View     | Update | Update    |
| Host Notes           | -       | -        | -      | Update    |

General recommendation for the Host:
- give each player an 'Owner' permission on their PC
- give all players a 'Limited' permission on PCs which are not their own
- during sessions, give players a 'Limited' permission on NPCs they meet, and do not put secret information in the 'Description' tab of these NPC sheets (unless you explicitly use the 'Secret' formatting option for it)

### Alternative: Diaries as ðŸ“– Journal Entries
To reinforce the notion of character diaries being a part of the world, the Host may elect to use dedicated ðŸ“– Journal Entries for each Player Character's (or NPC's) Diary.
In this case, the ðŸ“– Journal Entry should probably be drag-and-dropped into the Journal tab of the Character Sheet afterwards, for easier access by the player or Host.

## Card hands
It is highly recommended that you use the Castle Falkenstein FoundryVTT system with a Cards UI enhancement module.

| Module                                                                   | Compatibility with the Castle Falkenstein system |
